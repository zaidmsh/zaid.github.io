standards in python:

- adding a char to a string ```x += 'A'``` where adding to a list ``` x.append(34)```

These are function I learned from [Codecademy][code-cademy] for Python:

-```len(x)``` returns the length of x

-```raw_input(x)``` where x is a string message.

-```list.append(x)``` where x is the value being added.

-```list.pop(x)``` where x is the index u want to delete.

-```list.remove(x)``` where x is the item u want to remove.

-```randint(x,y)``` where  the range of the numbers is x - y. (it is imported from "random").

-```for index, item in enumerate(choices):``` enumerate helps seperates between the index and the value of the item in the index.

-```for a, b in zip(list_a, list_b):``` function zip() helps with iterating through multiple lists but stops when the shorter list finishes.

-```string.split()``` split the string into a list of words

-```'-'.join(x)``` joins a list of strings with the '-'

-``dict.items()``` returns the key/value pairs of the dictionary

-```dict.keys() or dict.values()``` returns the keys and the values respectively
