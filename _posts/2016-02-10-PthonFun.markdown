These are function I learned from [Codecademy][code-cademy] for Python:

```raw_input(x)``` where x is a string message

```list.append(x)``` where x is the value being added

```list.pop(x)``` where x is the index u want to delete
```list.remove(x)``` where x is the item u want to remove
```randint(x,y)``` where  the range of the numbers is x - y. (it is imported from "random")
